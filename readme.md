## ProfileMatching

Matching profiles using cross correlation.

### Description

This Samples shows how the profile API can be used to match profiles.

### How to run

This sample may currently be outdated.
Editing the UI might not work properly in the latest version of SICK AppStudio. Use SICK AppStudio version <= 2.4.2 to edit the UI.

Starting this sample is possible either by running the App (F5) or debugging (F7+F10). Setting breakpoint on the first row inside the 'main' function allows debugging step-by-step after 'Engine.OnStarted' event. Results can be seen in the image as well as the point cloud viewer on the DevicePage.
Restarting the Sample may be necessary to show images after loading the web-page. To run this Sample a device with SICK Algorithm API and AppEngine >= V2.5.0 is required. For example InspectorP or SIM4000 with latest firmware. Alternatively the Emulator on AppStudio 2.3 or higher can be used.
